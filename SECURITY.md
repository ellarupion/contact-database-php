# Security Policy

We take security seriously at **Contacts Tg Bot**, and we appreciate your help in keeping our project secure. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please let us know right away.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not report it publicly. Instead, please email us at ceo@xxiv.press with the following information:

- A description of the vulnerability

- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability

- Possible impact of the vulnerability

- Any mitigations or workarounds you are aware of

We will acknowledge receipt of your email within 48 hours and will work to validate and respond to the vulnerability as quickly as possible.

## Disclosure Policy

We will notify users of any security vulnerabilities that are discovered in our bot, as well as any mitigations or workarounds we recommend. We will do our best to provide regular updates on the status of any vulnerabilities, as well as an estimated timeline for resolution.

We ask that you do not publicly disclose any security vulnerabilities until we have had a chance to address them. We will work with you to acknowledge your contribution once the vulnerability has been resolved.

## Updates

We may update this security policy from time to time as our security practices evolve. We encourage you to review this policy periodically to stay informed about our approach to security.
